# BrickBreakerAlienTech (Five Day Challenge w/ Beta Branch)
This is the classic, Brick Breaker, but with a twist.

Sentient alien brick have invaded Earth. They are attempting to terraform Earth into a Minecraft clone (the horror). Fortunately, The UN had a contingency plan in place for this very event. Man your keyboard, because all your years of gaming have trained you for this very moment!

## How To Play
The goal of the game is to break bricks. Use the ball to break the bricks by bouncing the ball off of the paddle. If the ball touches the floor you lose a life. You have 3 lives to lose before the game is over. The bricks have health too. They must be hit five times before they break. On occasion, the bricks will absorb the ball to steal it's life force, however, they can also absorb too much and die. If this happens, the brick(s) that aborbed the ball will gain all their health back, then spit the ball back out in a random direction. Hidden inside several bricks are powerups that can do one of three things: 
1) Clone your ball
2) Give you 1 extra life
3) Allow your ball(s) to one hit all remaining bricks
The powerups will fall down once you break the brick they are hidden inside. To activate the powerup, simply allow it to fall onto your paddle.

Beta 1.1 Update 7/29:
