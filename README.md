# BrickBreakerAlienTech (Five Day Challenge w/ Beta Branch)
This is the classic, Brick Breaker, but with a twist.

Sentient alien brick have invaded Earth. They are attempting to terraform Earth into a Minecraft clone (the horror). Fortunately, The UN had a contingency plan in place for this very event. Man your keyboard, because all your years of gaming have trained you for this very moment!

## How To Play
The goal of the game is to break bricks. Use the ball to break the bricks by bouncing the ball off of the paddle. If the ball touches the floor you lose a life. You have 3 lives to lose before the game is over. The bricks have health too. They must be hit five times before they break. On occasion, the bricks will absorb the ball to steal it's life force, however, they can also absorb too much and die. If this happens, the brick(s) that aborbed the ball will gain all their health back, then spit the ball back out in a random direction.

## Controls
Use left and right arrow keys to control where the paddle moves.                  
Press F5 to restart the game.              
Use Alt+F4 to quit the game and abandon humanity.
